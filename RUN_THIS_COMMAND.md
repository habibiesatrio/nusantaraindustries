# Your site is showing a blank white page because the project was not built correctly.

You need to run the build command in your terminal.

## Open your terminal in the project folder and run this exact command:

```bash
npm run build
```

After this command finishes, upload the contents of the `build` folder to your server.

This is the only way to fix the white screen issue.
